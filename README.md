Analyzing Big Five traits and their correlation with Social Engineering susceptibility.

# The Human Factor: Behavioral Analysis of Social Engineering Susceptibility (Big Five Model)

 Project Overview

This project presents a data visualization and analysis framework that explores the critical link between **Big Five personality traits** and an individual's **vulnerability to social engineering attacks**.

Cybersecurity defense often focuses solely on technical controls. This analysis shifts the focus to the **Human Factor**, providing evidence and data-driven insights into how traits like *Agreeableness*, *Neuroticism*, and *Conscientiousness* correlate with different attack vectors (e.g., Phishing, Vishing, Baiting).

The goal is to move from generic security training to a **proactive, personalized resilience strategy**.

 Key Findings & Data Visualization

The visualization is built entirely on a single HTML page using **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Chart.js** for dynamic data representation. The key sections present:

1.  **Big Five Personality Traits:** A summary of the five core traits and their definition.
2.  **Correlation Charts:** Detailed bar charts illustrating the hypothetical **Risk Level (1-10)** of each Big Five trait against common Social Engineering attack vectors (Phishing, Spear-Phishing, Vishing, Smishing, Baiting).
3.  **Organizational Risk Profile (Hypothesis):** A Doughnut chart showing the estimated risk vector distribution in a typical workforce, highlighting the dominance of **Agreeableness** and **Neuroticism** as primary targets.
4.  **Mitigation Effectiveness:** A stacked bar chart that compares the effectiveness of different security interventions (e.g., Phishing Simulations, Behavioral Nudges) across various personality profiles.
5.  **Risk & Mitigation Framework:** An actionable table providing personalized security strategies tailored to counter the specific vulnerabilities associated with each trait.
